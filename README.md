## How to Download and Install Chrome for Mac

Every Mac comes with Apple's Safari web browser installed on it, and lots of people use it. Safari is far from the only browser you can use on a Mac, however. While the built-in option has benefits, you may want a different program, like Google Chrome. Here's how to put Google's browser on your Mac.

* Go to the download page for Chrome on the Mac you want to install it on. The site detects that you're using a Mac and automatically suggests the right version for you.

* Click Download Chrome for Mac.

* The installer program for Chrome downloads to your designated Downloads folder. Open the Downloads folder and double-click the file called googlechrome.dmg to launch the installer.

* Drag the Chrome icon to the Application folder icon. The installer will copy Chrome to your computer.

* Before you start using your new browser, clean up the installer files. If you don't, those files will use up space on your hard drive unnecessarily. Open a Finder window and click the arrow next to Google Chrome in the sidebar.

* Return to the Downloads folder and drag googlechrome.dmg to the trash.

* Go to your Applications folder and double-click Google Chrome to start using your new web browser.
